Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I interpret users needs by engaging regularly with them as well as ensuring I understand their perspective. The engagement with the users and stakeholders enables the development team to maintain a good relationship of trust and communication ultiamtly creating the ease of creating user stories to implement into the program. User stories are vital in implementing user needs as ut is a direct feedback from the end-user that can be wiehgted in priorirty to understand how impactful each story is. THe process of prioritizing is important to implement crucial changes for the quality of the product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach developing programs currently by segmenting the work, for isntance if I have multiple classes to build I'll make sure to build the parents first then work down from there. This is similar to the agile process of dividing the wokr into different user stories for the implementation. To further incorporate my future development I can weigh my implementations in my planned development to create a prioritized list for me to get the important features first.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member in a development team I believe it relies on three factos communication, humility, and the drive to learn. Communication is crucial in voicing feedback to others as well as communicating issues within the process. Humility is important for members to accept feedback, not a scriticism but as help. Lastly, the drive to learn is crucial for the team to continue to explore and improve, the desire to hone ones skills helps the products continue to improve.
